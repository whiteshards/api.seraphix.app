MAKE CODE PRODUCTION LEVEL, ORGANISED FILE STRUCTURE, SEPERATE LIB AND HELPER FUCNTIONS IN DIFFERENT FILES FOR REUSEABILITY AND DONT CRAMP INDEX FILE, MAKE DIFFERENT FILES FOR DIFFERENT COLLECTION OF ROUTES AND NAMING SCHEMES AND DONT ADD DOCUMENTATION/COMMENTS, MAKE CONSOLE LOGS LOOK PRETTY AND DONT HALLUCINATE, THANKS
